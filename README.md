# MathConnect
**MathConnect** is an engaging and challenging puzzle game inspired by 2048, but with a mathematical twist! Merge pieces by connecting numbers with operators to score high and master mathematical combos.

## How to Play
In MathConnect, you strategically merge tiles by connecting two numbers with a mathematical operator (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Keep an eye on the top row, which previews the upcoming pieces, and plan your moves to optimize your score and create impressive combos.

## Unique Game Mechanics
- **Predictive Spawning:** The game board shows potential spawn locations with a yellow outline. If multiple outlined spaces are available, the algorithm chooses a location with free space after your move. This predictive mechanism ensures there's always room for the next piece, adding a strategic layer to your gameplay.
- **Efficient Placement:** The algorithm is designed to place new tiles in the most efficient way possible, keeping the game challenging yet playable.
